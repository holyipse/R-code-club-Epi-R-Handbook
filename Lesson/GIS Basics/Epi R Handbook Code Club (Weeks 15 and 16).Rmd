### Vocabulary

  \   

* **GIS**: Geographic Information System, the tool you use to work with spatial data. 

* **Vector data**: Points, lines, and polygons. Spatial data that can be represented mathematically. 

<center>![](`r here("images","spatial_vector_data.png")`){width=35%}</center>

* **Raster data**: a matrix of pixels, where aspects of each pixel (like color) convey information. 

* **Shapefile**: file commonly used for storing vector data.

* **Coordinate Reference System** (CRS): coordinate based system for locating geographical features on a surface (like the earth). Mostly, we use latitude and longitude. A CRS is comprised of a coordinate system, units, datum, and a projection. 

* **Units**: decimal degrees, miles, feet meters.

* **Datum**: The model used to represent your underlying object (in most cases, the object of interest is earth)

* **Projection**: the model used to represent round shapes on a flat surface (like when going from globe to flat map.) Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections){target="_blank"} to look through different projections of the earth. 
  
  \   
  
### Types of Thematic Maps
  
  \   
  
For the most part, when we make a map, we're trying to convey some kind of information or geographic pattern. These kinds of maps are called thematic maps. Some examples of common thematic maps are:
  
  \   
  
* **Choropleth**: A map that uses colors, patterns or shading to represent an attribute value within predefined geographical boundaries. (Counties, states, provinces, countries, etc.)

<center>![](`r here("images","gis_choropleth.png")`){width=50%}</center>


* **Point/Dot/Case Density**: Where a point represents one or more events. These can be single events, or aggregated. For example, a point could mean 100 cases to save visual space. 

<center>![An example we're all pretty familiar with.](`r here("images","snow_map.jpg")`){width=40%}</center>
  
  \   
  
* **Case Density Heatmap**: This is similar to the previous type of map, but instead of dots, there will be a gradient representing areas of higher density. Sometimes these will also be called isopleth maps. The difference between this type of map and choropleth is that choropleth will always be defined by predetermined boundaries, and heat maps or isopleths will not. Additionally, there may be some amount of interpolation (defined in your methodology) between known and unknown points when compiling the gradient of a heat map. 
  
  \   
  
<center>![](`r here("images","gis_heatmap.png")`){width=50%}</center>
  
  \   
  
*A Note about language*: In practice, people use the term "heat map" to cover a range of thematic map types. It could be helpful to clarify before you build!

* **Proportional symbols**: A map where the size or other aspect of a graduated symbol displays the value of an attribute. 

<center>![](`r here("images","idaho_water_symbol.png")`){width=35%}</center>
  
  \   
  
* **Cartogram**: similar to proportional symbols, except the symbols used are the actual shapes of the map. 

* **Flow**: A flow map shows movement from one place to another. Mostly people, but can other things (a common subject is mosquito species in vectorborne diseases.)

## Make Some Maps  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Start with the Data {.tabset .tabset-pills}

**Sample Case Data**

To get started, we're going to read in data, and turn it into something mappable. To read in shape data, use read_sf(). To convert a dataframe to a mappable file, use st_as_sf().

```{r getdata, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

# linelist data
linelist_sf <- import(here("data","linelist_cleaned.rds"))  %>%
    #st as sf takes a dataframe and attempts to turn it into a shape file. 
     sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326) # assign coordinates as lat/lon and pick a CRS

sample_rows <- linelist[sample(nrow(linelist), 1000),]

# shapefile
sle_adm3_raw <- read_sf(here("data","gis","shp","sle_adm3.shp"))

# ADM3 level clean
sle_adm3 <- sle_adm3_raw %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% # standardize column names
  filter(admin2name %in% c("Western Area Urban", "Western Area Rural")) # filter to keep certain areas

# population data
sle_adm3_pop <- import(here("data", "gis", "sle_admpop_adm3_2020.csv")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# point data
sle_hf <- sf::read_sf(here("data", "gis", "shp","sle_hf.shp")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(amenity %in% c("hospital", "clinic", "doctors"))




```

#### tmap

```{r tmap1, exercise=TRUE}
# tell tmap to plot
tmap_mode("plot") # choose either "view" or "plot"


# All together
tm_shape(sle_adm3, bbox = c(-13.3, 8.43, -13.2, 8.5105)) +     
  tm_polygons(col = "#F7F7F7") + # add polygons
  tm_text("admin3name")+ # add polygon labels
tm_shape(linelist_sf) + # add points
  tm_dots(size=0.03, col='blue', alpha = 0.25) + # add points
  tm_layout(title = "Distribution of Ebola cases", frame=FALSE, # adjust the layout
            title.position = c('left', 'top'))   # give title to map

```


#### ggplot2

```{r ggplot1, exercise=TRUE}

ggplot(data = sle_adm3) +
  geom_sf(fill="#F7F7F7", col="black") + # add polygons
  geom_sf_text(aes(label=admin3name)) + # add polygon labels
  geom_sf(data=linelist_sf, col="blue", alpha = 0.25, size= 1) + # add points
  coord_sf(xlim=c(-13.3, -13.2), ylim=c(8.43, 8.5)) + # change the bounding box
  labs(title = "Distribution of Ebola cases") + # add a title
  theme_void() # remove most of the formatting

```


### Spatial Joins and Buffers

Spatial Joins (like regular joins) are used to combine information from two related data sets. Except now we're specifically talking about spatial data. This is done to add context or more information. 
  
  \   
  

#### Points in Polygons (st_intersects)

Our case data (points) doesn't already have information in the dataset about which administrative area (polygons) they fall within. We can see it when we look in the map, but it's helpful to have this information as an attribute. 

```{r sp_join1, exercise=TRUE}

# start with the linelist
head(linelist_sf)

# join with the polygon layer to get the parent polygon
linelist_adm <- linelist_sf %>%
  st_join(
    sle_adm3 %>% select(admin3pcod, admin3name)
    , join = st_intersects #  join = is how to specify what kind of spatial join
  )

head(linelist_adm)

# use the new data for vizzing!
ggplot(
    data = linelist_adm,                       # begin with linelist containing admin unit info
    mapping = aes(
      x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(admin3name))))+ # x-axis is admin units, ordered by frequency (reversed)
  geom_bar()+                                # create bars, height is number of rows
  coord_flip()+                              # flip X and Y axes for easier reading of adm units
  theme_classic()+                           # simplify background
  labs(                                      # titles and labels
    x = "Admin level 3",
    y = "Number of cases",
    title = "Number of cases, by adminstative unit",
    caption = "As determined by a spatial join, from 1000 randomly sampled cases from linelist"
  )

```

Using st_intersects assigns an administrative area, and from there, you can apply all kinds of aggregations and data viz approaches, beyond mapping. 
  
  \   
  

#### Nearest Neighbor (st_nearest_feature)

Given two sets of point data, cases and regional healthcare facilities, you can find the nearest facility per case with a nearest neighbor join. 

```{r join2, exercise=TRUE}

# Closest health facility to each case
linelist_sf_hf <- linelist_sf %>%                  # begin with linelist shapefile  
  st_join(sle_hf, join = st_nearest_feature) %>%   # data from nearest clinic joined to case data 
  select(case_id, osm_id, name, amenity) %>%       # keep columns of interest, including id, name, type, and geometry of healthcare facility
  rename("nearest_clinic" = "name")                # re-name for clarity

# Count cases by health facility
hf_catchment <- linelist_sf_hf %>%   # begin with linelist including nearest clinic data
  as.data.frame() %>%                # convert from shapefile to dataframe
  count(nearest_clinic,              # count rows by "name" (of clinic)
        name = "case_n") %>%         # assign new counts column as "case_n"
  arrange(desc(case_n))              # arrange in descending order

hf_catchment                         # print to console

tmap_mode("view")   # set tmap mode to interactive  

# plot the cases and clinic points 
tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf) +            # plot cases
  tm_dots(size=0.08,                  # cases colored by nearest clinic
          col='nearest_clinic') +    
tm_shape(sle_hf) +                    # plot clinic facilities in large black dots
  tm_dots(size=0.3, col='black', alpha = 0.4) +      
  tm_text("name") +                   # overlay with name of facility
tm_view(set.view = c(-13.2284, 8.4699, 13), # adjust zoom (center coords, zoom)
        set.zoom.limits = c(13,16)) +
tm_layout(title = "Cases, colored by nearest clinic")

```


  
  \   
  
#### Buffers

Next, we want to take the healthcare facilities, and draw a buffer or catchment area around them, to determine whether a case falls within that area. 

```{r join3, exercise=TRUE}

# create a buffer
sle_hf_buffer <- sle_hf %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 2500) # distance units are defined by your coordinate ref system (in this case, meters NOT degrees in the book)

# st_crs(sle_hf)  run st_crs on your shape and look for "LENGTHUNIT" to see what unit you're using

tmap_mode("plot") # switch back to non-interactive plots


tm_shape(sle_hf_buffer) +
  tm_polygons(col = "black", lwd = 1, alpha=0.1) + # to add the buffer as a solid shape
  # tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 1) + # to add the buffer as a border only
tm_shape(sle_hf) +                    # plot clinic facilities in red dots
  tm_dots(size=0.1, col='red')   


# Intersect the cases with the buffers
linelist_sf_hf_buffer <- linelist_sf_hf %>%
  st_join(sle_hf_buffer, join = st_intersects, left = TRUE) %>% # associate the cases with an intersecting buffer, left = TRUE turns the join into a directional join (where everything that matches + everything from one side is returned.)
  filter(osm_id.x==osm_id.y | is.na(osm_id.y)) %>% 
  select(case_id, osm_id.x, nearest_clinic, amenity.x, osm_id.y)

tmap_mode("view") #switch back to interactive

# First display the cases in points
tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf) +
  tm_dots(size=0.08, col='nearest_clinic') +

# plot clinic facilities in large black dots
tm_shape(sle_hf) +                    
  tm_dots(size=0.1, col='black')+   

# Then overlay the health facility buffers in polylines
tm_shape(sle_hf_buffer) +
  tm_polygons(col = "black", lwd = 1, alpha=0.1) +

# Highlight cases that are not part of any health facility buffers
# in red dots  
tm_shape(linelist_sf_hf_buffer %>%  filter(is.na(osm_id.y))) +
  tm_dots(size=0.1, col='red') +
tm_view(set.view = c(-13.2284,8.4699, 13), set.zoom.limits = c(13,14)) +

# add title  
tm_layout(title = "Cases by clinic catchment area")

```


### Choropleth Maps {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Now that we have the ability to assign cases to an administrative area with spatial joins, we can then summarize case volume for each area with a choropleth map

```{r choro_data, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
case_adm3 <- linelist_adm %>%          # begin with linelist with  admin cols from previous join
  as_tibble() %>%                      # convert to tibble for better display
  group_by(admin3pcod, admin3name) %>% # group by admin unit, both by name and pcode 
  summarise(cases = n()) %>%           # summarize and count rows
  arrange(desc(cases))                     # arrange in descending order

# Add population data and calculate cases per 10K population
case_adm3 <- case_adm3 %>% 
     left_join(sle_adm3_pop,                             # add columns from pop dataset
               by = c("admin3pcod" = "adm3_pcode")) %>%  # join based on common values across these two columns
     select(names(case_adm3), total) %>%                 # keep only important columns, including total population
     mutate(case_10kpop = round(cases/total * 10000, 3)) # make new column with case rate per 10000, rounded to 3 decimals

head(case_adm3)                                                # print to console for viewing


case_adm3_sf <- case_adm3 %>%                 # begin with cases & rate by admin unit
  left_join(sle_adm3, by="admin3pcod") %>%    # join to shapefile data by common column
  select(objectid, admin3pcod,                # keep only certain columns of interest
         admin3name = admin3name.x,           # clean name of one column
         admin2name, admin1name,
         cases, total, case_10kpop,
         geometry) %>%                        # keep geometry so polygons can be plotted
  drop_na(objectid) %>%                       # drop any empty rows
  st_as_sf()                                  # convert to shapefile

```

#### tmap

```{r choro_tmap, exercise=TRUE}
# tmap mode
tmap_mode("plot")               # view static map

# plot polygons
tm_shape(case_adm3_sf) + 
        tm_polygons("cases") +  # color by number of cases column
        # tm_polygons("case_10kpop", breaks=c(0, 10, 50, 100), palette = "Purples") +
        tm_text("admin3name") +  # name display
        tm_layout(frame=FALSE) 
```

#### ggplot2

```{r choro_ggplot, exercise=TRUE}

tmap_cols = c("#fef6ba","#fecf66","#f88b22","#cc4c02")
tmap_brks = c(0,500,1000,1500,2000)

ggplot(data = case_adm3_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=cases)) + 
    # scale_fill_stepsn(colors=tmap_cols, breaks=tmap_brks) +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = admin3name), size=3) +
  theme_void()


```

### Basemaps + OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is an open source project to create and disseminate international raster layers for use by the public. We'll create a map with a detailed base layer, and then plot it using autoplot.OpenStreetMap(). 

```{r osm_basemaps, exercise=TRUE}

# Fit basemap by range of lat/long coordinates. Choose tile type
map <- OpenStreetMap::openmap(
  upperLeft = c(max(linelist$lat, na.rm=T), max(linelist$lon, na.rm=T)),   # limits of basemap tile
  lowerRight = c(min(linelist$lat, na.rm=T), min(linelist$lon, na.rm=T)),
  zoom = NULL,
  type = c("osm", "stamen-toner", "stamen-terrain", "stamen-watercolor", "esri","esri-topo")[1])

# autoplot the map
autoplot.OpenStreetMap(map)



```

### Case Density Maps

If you have a lot of cases (points), sometimes overlap can cause visual noise that makes interpretation a little tricky.

```{r casedensity1, exercise=TRUE}
# change the basemap to use the same projection and CRS as our sf objects
map_latlon <- OpenStreetMap::openproj(map, projection = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")

# check out the points on top of our basemap 
# Plot map. Must be autoplotted to work with ggplot
OpenStreetMap::autoplot.OpenStreetMap(map_latlon)+                 # begin with the basemap
  geom_point(                                       # add xy points from linelist lon and lat columns 
    data = linelist,                                
    aes(x = lon, y = lat),
    size = 1, 
    alpha = 0.25,
    show.legend = FALSE) +                          # drop legend entirely
  labs(x = "Longitude",                             # titles & labels
       y = "Latitude",
       title = "Cumulative cases")


```

The overlapping dots make it a little hard to see  a pattern. Next we'll apply a contour to see if it helps us see a pattern. 

```{r casedensity2, exercise=TRUE}

# begin with the basemap
OpenStreetMap::autoplot.OpenStreetMap(map_latlon) + 
  
  # add the density plot
  ggplot2::stat_density_2d(
        data = linelist,
        aes(
          x = lon,
          y = lat,
          fill = ..level..,
          alpha = ..level..),
        bins = 10,
        geom = "polygon",
        contour_var = "count",
        show.legend = F) +                          
  
  # specify color scale
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#3C0E58", high = "#E0BAF7")+
  
  # labels 
  labs(x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       title = "Distribution of cumulative cases")

```

As a bonus, we can create a formatted time column and use that to view trends over time.

```{r casedensity3, exercise=TRUE}


# begin with the basemap
autoplot.OpenStreetMap(map_latlon)+
  
  # add the density plot
  ggplot2::stat_density_2d(
        data = linelist %>% mutate(date_onset_ym = format(date_onset, "%Y-%m")), # create a formatted YRMO column
        aes(
          x = lon,y = lat,
          fill = ..level..,
          alpha = ..level..),
        bins = 10,
        geom = "polygon",
        contour_var = "count",
        show.legend = F) +                          
  
  # specify color scale
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#3C0E58", high = "#E0BAF7")+
  
  # labels 
  labs(x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       title = "Distribution of cumulative cases over time")+
  
  # facet the plot by month-year of onset
  facet_wrap(~ date_onset_ym, ncol = 4)               

```

## Spatial Statistics {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Previously, we created thematic maps, and intuitively determine patterns based on the visualizations. Now, we'll walk through some statistical methods for quantifying those patterns and relationships. 

For most of this work, we'll use the **spdep** package.

### Adjacency

The first step in working with spatial statistics is to define how things are related. The typical first step is to quantify adjacency. 

Functions:

* poly2nb: creates a list of neighbors in your dataset
* nb2mat: takes a list created by pol2nb and turns it into a summary matrix
* nv2listw: creates a list of weights


```{r spdep1, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
sle_adm3_dat <- sle_adm3 %>% 
  inner_join(case_adm3, by = "admin3pcod")

sle_nb <- spdep::poly2nb(sle_adm3_dat, queen=F) # create neighbors, the queen=TRUE argument says that neighbors will share at least one point in common.queen=FALSE looks for at least 2 points (or a line) in common.
sle_adjmat <- spdep::nb2mat(sle_nb)    # create matrix summarizing neighbor relationships
sle_listw <- spdep::nb2listw(sle_nb)   # create listw (list of weights) object -- we will need this later

sle_nb

# plot the relationships

plot(sle_adm3_dat$geometry) +                                           # plot region boundaries
  spdep::plot.nb(sle_nb,as(sle_adm3_dat, 'Spatial'), col='grey', add=T) # add neighbor relationships

```



### Spatial Autocorrelation  {.tabset}

Basically, the following are various tests for how things relate to each other in a given space. 
  
  \   
  

#### Global Moran I

This is a global summary statistic of the correlation between the value of a variable in one region, and the values of the same variable in neighboring regions. The Moran’s I statistic typically ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no pattern of spatial correlation, while values closer to 1 or -1 indicate stronger spatial autocorrelation (similar values close together) or spatial dispersion (dissimilar values close together), respectively.

The spdep package has a function, moran.test, that can do this calculation for us:

```{r spatcorr_moran1, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

moran_i <-spdep::moran.test(sle_adm3_dat$cases,    # numeric vector with variable of interest
                            listw=sle_listw)       # listw object summarizing neighbor relationships

moran_i                                            # print results of Moran's I test

```

#### Local Moran I

A global Moran test looks across the entire dataset. A local Moran test applies the test within localized regions.

We can decompose the (global) Moran’s I statistic calculated above to identify localized spatial autocorrelation; that is, to identify specific clusters in our data. This statistic, which is sometimes called a **Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA)** statistic, summarizes the extent of spatial autocorrelation around each individual region. It can be useful for finding “hot” and “cold” spots on the map.

To show an example, we can calculate and map Local Moran’s I for the Ebola case counts used above, with the local_moran() function from spdep:

```{r spatcorr_moran2, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

# calculate local Moran's I
local_moran <- spdep::localmoran(                  
  sle_adm3_dat$cases,                              # variable of interest
  listw=sle_listw                                  # listw object with neighbor weights
)

# join results to sf data
sle_adm3_dat<- cbind(sle_adm3_dat, local_moran)    

# plot map
ggplot(data=sle_adm3_dat) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=Ii)) +

#### Getis-Ord Gi*

Also called High-Low Clustering.

This is another statistic that is commonly used for hotspot analysis; it's mostly known in the context of ArcGIS. It is based on the assumption that typically, the difference in a variable’s value between neighboring regions should follow a normal distribution. It uses a z-score approach to identify regions that have significantly higher (hot spot) or significantly lower (cold spot) values of a specified variable, compared to their neighbors.

The Gi* statistic is sort of like a two sided statistical test in that it looks for clustering of both high and low values, and you interpret the results in the context of a null hypothesis. (And it comes with a p-value!) 

We can calculate and map the Gi* statistic using the localG() function from spdep.

```{r spatcorr_gi1, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
# Perform local G analysis
getis_ord <- spdep::localG(
  sle_adm3_dat$cases,
  sle_listw # the list of weights from neighbors
)

# join results to sf data
sle_adm3_dat$getis_ord <- as.numeric(getis_ord)

# plot map
ggplot(data=sle_adm3_dat) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=getis_ord)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="#2c7bb6", mid="#ffffbf", high="#d7191c",
                       name="Gi*") +
  labs(title="Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for Ebola cases",
       subtitle="Admin level 3 regions, Sierra Leone")

```


#### Lee's L Test

This is a statistical test for bivariate spatial correlation. It allows you to test whether the spatial pattern for a given variable x is similar to the spatial pattern of another variable, y, that is hypothesized to be related spatially to x.

To give an example, let’s test whether the spatial pattern of Ebola cases from the simulated epidemic is correlated with the spatial pattern of population. To start, we need to have a population variable in our sle_adm3 data. We can use the total variable from the sle_adm3_pop dataframe that we loaded earlier.

```{r spatcorr_lee1, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
sle_adm3_dat <- sle_adm3_dat %>% 
  rename(population = total)                          # rename 'total' to 'population'

tmap_mode("plot")

cases_map <- tm_shape(sle_adm3_dat) + tm_polygons("cases") + tm_layout(main.title="Cases")
pop_map <- tm_shape(sle_adm3_dat) + tm_polygons("population") + tm_layout(main.title="Population")

tmap_arrange(cases_map, pop_map, ncol=2)   # arrange into 2x1 facets

```

Intuitively, the population of these regions looks different than the number of cases. So let's quantify this suspicion. 

```{r spatcorr_lee2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lee_test <- spdep::lee.test(
  x=sle_adm3_dat$cases,          # variable 1 to compare
  y=sle_adm3_dat$population,     # variable 2 to compare
  listw=sle_listw                # listw object with neighbor weights
)

lee_test # print the results
```

The L statistic will be close to 0 if there is no correlation between the patterns, close to 1 if there is a strong positive correlation (i.e. the patterns are similar), and close to -1 if there is a strong negative correlation (i.e. the patterns are inverse).

The statistic demonstrates what we could already kind of guess just by looking at it.
